<p class="about">Instagram4Kids is a social platform and experiment. I wanted to create a project similar that to Instagram. 
This site is not intended to compete with Instagram in any way, shape, or form. Just for fun and giggles, my dad and I wanted to
test our development chops to see if we could recreate such an iconic social media platform with a twist.</p>

<p>Let's network and foster key social relationships with the broader community.</p>
